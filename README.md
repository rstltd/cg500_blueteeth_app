# CG500 BLE App

A comprehensive Flutter application for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device scanning and communication using Nordic UART Service.

## Features

- **BLE Device Scanning**: Automatic discovery with animated scanning indicators and signal strength visualization
- **Nordic UART Service Communication**: Text command communication via standardized BLE UART protocol
- **Modern Responsive UI**: Material Design 3 with dark/light themes and responsive layouts for mobile/tablet/desktop
- **Smart Notification System**: Intelligent filtering to prevent notification spam with user-configurable settings
- **Chat-Style Command Interface**: Real-time bidirectional communication with command history and message bubbles
- **Connection Management**: Visual connection states with duration tracking and automatic reconnection
- **Automatic Updates**: GitHub Releases-based update system with in-app notifications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (^3.8.1)
- Android development environment
- Bluetooth Low Energy capable device

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rstltd/cg500_blueteeth_app.git
   cd cg500_blueteeth_app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

1. **Scan for devices**: Tap "Start Scanning" button
2. **Connect to device**: Tap connect icon next to desired device  
3. **Access Command Interface**: After device connection, tap the chat icon (ðŸ’¬) in the top-right corner
4. **Send text commands**: In the command interface, type commands and press Enter or tap Send
5. **View responses**: Device responses appear in real-time in the communication log

## BLE Protocol

- **Service**: Nordic UART Service (UUID: 6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e)
- **TX/RX Channels**: RX for phoneâ†’device (6e400002), TX for deviceâ†’phone (6e400003)
- **MTU**: Auto-configured to 517 bytes for optimal throughput
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 text with full international character support

## Development
