## BLE Usage Guide

### Basic Operations:
1. **Scan for devices**: Tap "Start Scanning" button
2. **Connect to device**: Tap connect icon next to desired device  
3. **Access Command Interface**: After device connection, tap the chat icon (ðŸ’¬) in the top-right corner
4. **Send text commands**: In the command interface, type commands and press Enter or tap Send
5. **View responses**: Device responses appear in real-time in the communication log
6. **Navigate command history**: Use up/down arrows to browse previous commands

### Nordic UART Service Communication:
- **Standard Protocol**: Uses Nordic UART Service (UUID: 6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e)
- **TX/RX Channels**: RX for phone->device (6e400002), TX for device->phone (6e400003)

- **UTF-8 Text Encoding**: Full international character support
- **Real-time Bidirectional**: Instant command sending and response display
- **Command History**: Navigate through last 20 commands with arrow keys
- **Connection Monitoring**: Live status indicators and duration tracking

### Supported GATT Operations:
- Service discovery with automatic UUID recognition for common services
- Characteristic property detection (Read/Write/Notify/Indicate)
- Hex and string value display for characteristic data
- Write operations with hex string parsing (supports "01,FF,A0" or "01FFA0" formats)

## UI/UX Architecture

### Responsive Design System
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile (<600px), Tablet (600-1024px), Desktop (>1024px)
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Different UI arrangements for each screen size
- **Theme System**: Persistent dark/light mode with comprehensive color palette
- **Animation Framework**: Smooth transitions, scanning effects, and micro-interactions

### Smart Notification System

- **User Controls**: Configurable notification categories and preferences  
- **Statistics**: Track filtered vs shown notifications for optimization
- **Silent Operations**: Internal processes (MTU config, etc.) don't spam users

### Nordic UART Service Implementation
```dart
// Key Nordic UART Service UUIDs used throughout the app
const String nordicUartServiceUuid = "6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e";
const String nordicUartRxUuid = "6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e"; // RX - phone writes to device  
const String nordicUartTxUuid = "6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e"; // TX - device notifies phone

// Controller usage for BLE operations
final SimpleBleController controller = SimpleBleController();
await controller.initialize();
await controller.connectToDevice(deviceId);
bool success = await controller.sendCommand("your command here");
```

### Signal Strength Optimization
RSSI thresholds optimized for typical BLE operating ranges:
- Excellent: â‰¥-40dBm 
- Very Good: â‰¥-55dBm
- Good: â‰¥-70dBm  
- Fair: â‰¥-85dBm
- Poor: <-85dBm
